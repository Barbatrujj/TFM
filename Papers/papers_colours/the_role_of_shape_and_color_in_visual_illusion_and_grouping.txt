the role of shape and color in visual illusion and grouping

this study analyzes how shape and color contribute to visual illusions and perceptual grouping. the authors show that certain color patterns and shape configurations can induce misleading perceptions, affecting the segmentation and organization of objects in vision. these findings highlight the importance of the interaction between visual attributes in perception and offer useful information for graphic design, neuroaesthetics, and understanding the mechanisms of visual grouping
