Extended Scientific-Based Document (No final synthesis section)

------------------------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------
Color perception is not only a visual phenomenon but also a physiological and emotional one. Different hues, brightness levels, and saturation intensities trigger specific neural responses, influence emotional states, and interact with rhythmic stimulation such as flicker frequencies and audiovisual entrainment. This document compiles scientific insights strictly focused on the relationship between colors, temporal frequencies, emotional reactions, and multisensory correspondences, with emphasis on what happens for each individual color.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF COLOR–BRAIN–EMOTION INTERACTION
------------------------------------------------------------
Color modulates emotional intensity, cognitive performance, arousal, and aesthetic evaluation. Saturation and brightness amplify emotional impact, while luminance affects arousal. Flicker and rhythmic frequencies further influence how color-driven stimuli entrain brain oscillations.

Key principles:
- Hue determines emotional direction (type of emotion).
- Saturation determines emotional intensity.
- Brightness determines emotional valence (positive vs heavy).
- Flicker frequency determines neural entrainment strength.
- Color interacts with musical tempo, pitch, and timbre through crossmodal associations.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. RED: HIGH AROUSAL, ALERTNESS, ACTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------
Red is consistently associated with high arousal, increased physiological activation, and heightened attention.  
Emotional effects:
- Increases tension, urgency, and emotional intensity.
- Associated with excitement, danger, passion, and physical stimulation.
- Enhances performance in tasks requiring attention to detail.

Frequency effects:
- At high flicker frequencies, red stimuli produce strong SSVEP amplitudes due to high luminance contrast.
- Often amplifies gamma-band entrainment (~30–100 Hz).

Crossmodal associations:
- Mapped to high‑energy, aggressive, or "harsh" musical timbres.
- Corresponds to fast tempos, strong beats, and high emotional activation.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. ORANGE: ENERGY, WARMTH, SOCIABILITY
------------------------------------------------------------
Orange maintains the arousal level of red but with more warmth and friendliness.  
Emotional effects:
- Stimulates motivation and enthusiasm.
- Associated with social warmth, playfulness, and extroversion.
- Less aggressive than red but still energizing.

Frequency effects:
- Produces mid‑high SSVEP amplitudes at 8–20 Hz flicker ranges.
- Maintains strong neural entrainment with moderate saturation.

Crossmodal associations:
- Connects to rhythmic, upbeat music.
- Matches mid‑to‑fast tempos.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. YELLOW: BRIGHTNESS, VIGILANCE, COGNITIVE ALERTNESS
------------------------------------------------------------
Yellow is associated with heightened attention and optimistic emotional tone.  
Emotional effects:
- Elevates mood and supports creativity.
- Enhances cognitive alertness and reaction time.
- Can induce anxiety at high saturation.

Frequency effects:
- Highly effective in low‑frequency flicker (<10 Hz) for emotional modulation.
- Strong entrainment for attention‑related rhythms (~8–12 Hz).

Crossmodal associations:
- Linked with high pitches, bright timbres, and "light" musical textures.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. GREEN: BALANCE, NATURE, CALM ACTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------
Green represents a midpoint between activation and calmness.  
Emotional effects:
- Associated with equilibrium, relaxation, and comfort.
- Reduces stress responses while maintaining alertness.
- Supports sustained focus rather than speed‑driven cognition.

Frequency effects:
- Strong responses at mid‑range SSVEP frequencies (12–20 Hz).
- Stable entrainment due to balanced luminance.

Crossmodal associations:
- Matches natural, soft timbres and ambient or slow‑medium tempo music.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. BLUE: CALMNESS, DEPTH, COGNITIVE OPENNESS
------------------------------------------------------------
Blue strongly correlates with relaxation and lowered physiological arousal.  
Emotional effects:
- Enhances calmness, introspection, and emotional stability.
- Improves creativity and abstract thinking.
- Reduces stress markers.

Frequency effects:
- Produces stronger entrainment at lower flicker frequencies (4–8 Hz).
- Supports theta‑range synchronization, linked to calm attention.

Crossmodal associations:
- Linked with soft, smooth timbres and slower tempos.
- Often paired with melodic, emotional music.

------------------------------------------------------------
8. PURPLE / VIOLET: MYSTERY, INTENSITY, AESTHETIC DEPTH
------------------------------------------------------------
Purple combines the stability of blue with the arousal of red.  
Emotional effects:
- Induces introspective, intense, or "mystical" mood states.
- Associated with luxury, depth, and emotional complexity.

Frequency effects:
- Moderate SSVEP amplitudes depending on brightness.
- Effective in both low and mid‑frequency entrainment tasks.

Crossmodal associations:
- Linked to emotional, atmospheric music.
- Colors of spiritual or immersive audiovisual environments.

------------------------------------------------------------
9. PINK: SOFTNESS, DELICACY, EMOTIONAL WARMTH
------------------------------------------------------------
Pink moderates the arousal of red with softness.  
Emotional effects:
- Produces soothing emotional tones.
- Associated with affection, vulnerability, and emotional softness.
- Lower arousal, higher comfort.

Frequency effects:
- Strongest entrainment at very low flicker (<6 Hz) when pastel.
- For neon pink, entrainment strength rises sharply at high saturation.

Crossmodal associations:
- Associated with delicate timbres, quiet vocals, and emotional clarity.

------------------------------------------------------------
10. WHITE AND HIGH-BRIGHTNESS COLORS: CLARITY, POSITIVITY
------------------------------------------------------------
Emotional effects:
- Increases perceived openness and clarity.
- Produces light, positive emotional states.

Frequency effects:
- High‑brightness flicker easily reaches critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF).
- Strong entrainment at high frequencies (30–50 Hz).

------------------------------------------------------------
11. BLACK AND LOW‑BRIGHTNESS COLORS: DEPTH, TENSION, WEIGHT
------------------------------------------------------------
Emotional effects:
- Associated with emotional heaviness, seriousness, or tension.
- Evokes introspection and psychological depth.

Frequency effects:
- Low luminance reduces SSVEP amplitude.
- Effective for low‑frequency entrainment (<6 Hz).

------------------------------------------------------------
12. COLOR–FREQUENCY–EMOTION MATRIX (COMBINED EFFECTS)
------------------------------------------------------------
Hue → determines emotional type  
Saturation → determines emotional intensity  
Brightness → determines emotional valence  
Flicker frequency → determines neural engagement  
Crossmodal music associations → reinforce the emotional meaning of color

This matrix informs audiovisual design, immersive environments, music‑reactive visuals, and neuroaesthetic applications.
