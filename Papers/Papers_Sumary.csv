"Color vision","Gegenfurtner, K. R. & Kiper, D. C.",2003,"This paper reviews the neural mechanisms underlying color perception in humans. It describes how the retina encodes color information using three types of cones (S, M, L) sensitive to different wavelengths. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and visual cortex, signals are combined in opponent channels (red-green, blue-yellow, luminance) that construct color perception. It emphasizes that color perception is a distributed process, dependent on integration with shape, motion, and luminance.","color, perception, retina, LGN, opponent channels, visual cortex, hues, luminance, visual processing, shape-color integration"
"A direct demonstration of functional specialization in human visual cortex","Zeki, S.",1991,"This study demonstrates that the human visual cortex is organized into functionally specialized areas for processing different visual attributes, such as color, shape, and motion. Using neuroimaging techniques, Zeki shows that area V4 is primarily involved in color processing, while area V5 (MT) responds selectively to motion. These findings support the idea that visual perception emerges from the coordinated integration of multiple specialized modules.","visual cortex, functional specialization, V4 area, V5 area, color processing, motion processing, neuroimaging, visual perception, specialized modules"
"Three cortical stages of colour processing in the human brain","Zeki, S.",1998,"This paper describes three cortical stages in color processing in the human brain. The first occurs in area V1, where neurons respond to simple color contrasts. The second stage, in area V2, integrates signals of different wavelengths. Finally, the third stage, in area V4, represents stable and conscious color perception, independent of illumination. The work demonstrates that the experience of color is the result of a hierarchy of progressive processing through the visual cortex.","color processing, visual cortex, area V1, area V2, area V4, color perception, cortical hierarchy, color integration, visual experience"

"Representation of perceived object shape by the human lateral occipital complex","Kourtzi, Z. & Kanwisher, N.",2001,"This study demonstrates that the lateral occipital complex (LOC) of the human brain represents the perceived shape of objects, rather than their simple physical characteristics. Using fMRI, the authors observed that activity in the LOC remains stable even when visual aspects such as texture, color, or lighting change, as long as the perceived shape of the object remains the same. This suggests that the LOC plays a crucial role in the abstraction and recognition of shapes, independent of superficial sensory information","lateral occipital complex, LOC, perceived shape, fMRI, object recognition, shape abstraction, sensory independence, visual perception"
"The lateral occipital complex and its role in object recognition","Grill-Spector, K., Kourtzi, Z. & Kanwisher, N.",2001,"This study delves into the role of the lateral occipital complex (LOC) in object recognition.
