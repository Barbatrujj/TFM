"Color vision","Gegenfurtner, K. R. & Kiper, D. C.",2003,"This paper reviews the neural mechanisms underlying color perception in humans. It describes how the retina encodes color information using three types of cones (S, M, L) sensitive to different wavelengths. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and visual cortex, signals are combined in opponent channels (red-green, blue-yellow, luminance) that construct color perception. It emphasizes that color perception is a distributed process, dependent on integration with shape, motion, and luminance.","color, perception, retina, LGN, opponent channels, visual cortex, hues, luminance, visual processing, shape-color integration"
"A direct demonstration of functional specialization in human visual cortex","Zeki, S.",1991,"This study demonstrates that the human visual cortex is organized into functionally specialized areas for processing different visual attributes, such as color, shape, and motion. Using neuroimaging techniques, Zeki shows that area V4 is primarily involved in color processing, while area V5 (MT) responds selectively to motion. These findings support the idea that visual perception emerges from the coordinated integration of multiple specialized modules.","visual cortex, functional specialization, V4 area, V5 area, color processing, motion processing, neuroimaging, visual perception, specialized modules"
"Three cortical stages of colour processing in the human brain","Zeki, S.",1998,"This paper describes three cortical stages in color processing in the human brain. The first occurs in area V1, where neurons respond to simple color contrasts. The second stage, in area V2, integrates signals of different wavelengths. Finally, the third stage, in area V4, represents stable and conscious color perception, independent of illumination. The work demonstrates that the experience of color is the result of a hierarchy of progressive processing through the visual cortex.","color processing, visual cortex, area V1, area V2, area V4, color perception, cortical hierarchy, color integration, visual experience"
"The architecture of the colour centre in the human visual cortex","Bartels, A. & Zeki, S.",2000,"This study analyzes the functional organization of area V4, considered the “color center” in the human visual cortex. Using fMRI, the authors show that V4 is not a single region, but a distributed set of subregions that respond selectively to different aspects of color, such as saturation, contrast, and color constancy. The results support the idea of a distributed cortical network dedicated to color processing, rather than a single module.","V4 area, color center, visual cortex, fMRI, color processing, functional organization, subregions, saturation, contrast, color constancy"
"Categorical encoding of color in the brain","Bird, C. M. et al.",2014,"This study investigates how the brain encodes colors into perceptual categories. Using fMRI, the authors found that regions of the occipital and temporal cortex respond differently to colors belonging to different linguistic categories, even when the physical differences are minimal. This suggests that color encoding depends not only on sensory perception, but also on cognitive and linguistic factors, demonstrating an interaction between visual perception and conceptual representation","color encoding, perceptual categories, fMRI, occipital cortex, temporal cortex, sensory perception, cognitive factors, language, perception-concept interaction"

The authors review neurophysiological and neuroimaging evidence indicating that V4 is not only specialized in color processing, but also participates in the encoding of shape, texture, and spatial organization of visual stimuli.

"Representation of perceived object shape by the human lateral occipital complex","Kourtzi, Z. & Kanwisher, N.",2001,"This study demonstrates that the lateral occipital complex (LOC) of the human brain represents the perceived shape of objects, rather than their simple physical characteristics. Using fMRI, the authors observed that activity in the LOC remains stable even when visual aspects such as texture, color, or lighting change, as long as the perceived shape of the object remains the same. This suggests that the LOC plays a crucial role in the abstraction and recognition of shapes, independent of superficial sensory information","lateral occipital complex, LOC, perceived shape, fMRI, object recognition, shape abstraction, sensory independence, visual perception"
"The lateral occipital complex and its role in object recognition","Grill-Spector, K., Kourtzi, Z. & Kanwisher, N.",2001,"This study delves into the role of the lateral occipital complex (LOC) in object recognition. Using fMRI, it was observed that the LOC responds strongly to the perception of complete objects compared to their fragmented parts or stimuli without a coherent shape. Furthermore, its activation is associated with conscious identification of objects rather than simple visual detection. These results consolidate the LOC as a key region in the visual hierarchy for shape and object recognition","lateral occipital complex, LOC, object recognition, fMRI, visual perception, conscious identification, visual hierarchy, coherent forms"
"Shape perception reduces activity in human primary visual cortex","Murray, S. O. et al.",2002,"This study reveals that coherent perception of form reduces activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). Using fMRI, the authors demonstrated that when observers perceive an organized figure from ambiguous visual stimuli, activity in V1 decreases, while it increases in higher regions such as the lateral occipital complex (LOC). These results suggest that shape perception involves hierarchical processing with feedback from higher areas, which optimizes the efficiency of visual processing","shape perception, primary visual cortex, V1, fMRI, lateral occipital complex, LOC, hierarchical processing, feedback, visual efficiency"
"The large-scale organization of shape processing in visual cortex","Freud, E. et al.",2017,"This study explores the large-scale organization of shape processing in the human visual cortex. Using fMRI and functional connectivity analysis, the authors show that shape processing is not limited to a single region (such as the LOC), but involves a distributed network that includes ventral and dorsal areas. Functional gradients representing different levels of form abstraction, from local features to global representations of objects, are identified.

"Imagining material versus geometric properties of objects","Newman, S. D. et al.",2005,"This study examines how the brain differentiates between imagining the material properties (such as texture or brightness) and geometric properties (such as shape or contour) of objects. Using fMRI, the authors found that imagining material properties activates regions related to ventral tactile and visual perception, while geometric properties involve more dorsal areas associated with spatial analysis.
