The Trail CHOP displays a history of its input channels back in time. A window of time is displayed from the current frame back in time, the size of this window is set by the Window Length parameter. The last sample in the Trail CHOP is a sample of the input at the current frame.

Note: If the input channels change in number or names, the Trail CHOP clears its trails and begins anew. You can use a Replace CHOP in this case to create stand in values.

Parameters - Trail Page
Active active - When On the Trail CHOP will record its input.

Grow Length growlength - When On the length of the Trail CHOP's recording will keep getting longer as the timeline moves forward. Use this for recording any length as needed.

Window Length wlength - The amount of history recorded is set by Window Length. The Units menu on the right determine which units to use in the parameter (Samples, Frames, Seconds). A setting of 4 seconds will show the value of the input channel for the previous 4 seconds.

Window Length Unit wlengthunit - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for the Window Length parameter.

Capture capture - ⊞ - Determines when to capture values.

Resample resample - Enable parameter below to resample the output to a different length.

Resample samples - Resample the output to this specified length.

Rate setrate - Enable parameter below to use a different sample rate.

Sample Rate rate - Resample using this sample rate instead of the global frame rate ($FPS).

Reset reset - While On, this toggle resets the channel(s) to 0.

Reset Pulse resetpulse - Click to instantly resets the channel(s) to 0.



Parameters - Common Page
Time Slice timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

Scope scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

Sample Rate Match srselect - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

Export Method exportmethod - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

Export Root autoexportroot - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

Export Table exporttable - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

Rename from commonrenamefrom - The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

Rename to commonrenameto - The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement.
Example:

Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient
Rename From: c* ambient
Rename To: b[1-5] amb
This example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient.

They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.

See the Rename CHOP for a further description of rename patterns.
