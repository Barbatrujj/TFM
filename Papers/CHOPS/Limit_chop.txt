The Limit CHOP can limit the values of the input channels to be between a minimum and maximum, and can quantize the input channels in time and/or value such that the value steps over time.

Limiting a channel causes all its values to lie within a range. Several different methods are for limiting are listed under the Type parameter description.

Quantizing a channel value snaps its values to the closest allowable value (the "quantized values"). Quantizing methods are: Floor, Ceiling, and Round.

Quantizing a channel index is like quantizing in time, and acts as a sample and hold mechanism. The channel is sampled at a quantized index, and held at that value until the next quantized index at which time the value takes on the input value at that point.

Parameters - Limit Page
Type type - ⊞ - Select limit options such as loop, clamp, or zigzag from the menu. The value will remain in the range from Min to less than Max.

Minimum min - The minimum value the output channel can have.

Maximum max - The maximum value the output channel can have.

Positive Only positive - Takes the absolute value of the channel, making all negative values positive.

Normalize norm - Scale and offset the channel so that it lies between -1 and +1. The Normalize function does not work with Time Slicing on.

Fix Underflows underflow - This will cause extremely tiny numbers to be rounded to 0.



Parameters - Quantize Page
Quantize Value quantvalue - ⊞ - Selects the quantization method to use:

Value Step vstep - The increment between quantized values.

Value Offset voffset - The offset for quantized values, to allow steps to not lie at zero, the default.

Quantize Index quantindex - ⊞ - Selects whether to quantize the index relative to the sample 0, or the start index of the CHOP.

Step istep - The increment between quantized indices, in seconds, frames or samples.

Step Unit istepunit -

Offset ioffset - The offset for quantized indices.

Offset Unit ioffsetunit -



Parameters - Common Page
Time Slice timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

Scope scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

Sample Rate Match srselect - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

Export Method exportmethod - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

Export Root autoexportroot - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

Export Table exporttable - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

Rename from commonrenamefrom - The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

Rename to commonrenameto - The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement.
Example:

Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient
Rename From: c* ambient
Rename To: b[1-5] amb
This example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient.

They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.

See the Rename CHOP for a further description of rename patterns.
