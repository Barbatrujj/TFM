he Function CHOP provides more complicated math functions than found in the Math CHOP : trigonometic functions, logarithmic functions and exponential functions, and also audio decibels (dB)-power-amplitude conversions.

Most of the functions require only one parameter, and they are applied as a unary operator to each input channel. Some functions take two parameters, and these require the use of the second input. The first parameter, X, is always a value from a channel in the first input. The second parameter, Y, is a value from a corresponding channel in the second input. Channels from each input are paired by name or index.

Since many of these functions can produce math errors, an error handling tab is provided for error handling and recovery. Errors can be handled by replacing the bad sample with a pre-defined value or by using the value of the previous sample. Alternatively, cooking can be aborted upon error for debugging networks.

Function types in decibels: as you would employ for audio or other signal strengths. -10dB means 1/10 the power, -20dB means 1/100 the power. It turns out that each 3dB means almost exactly double the power, so +12dB is 2*2*2*2 = 16 times the power. Power is proportional to the square of the amplitude. So -20dB means 1/10 the amplitude, and 6dB is double the amplitude.

Parameters - Function Page
Function func - ⊞ - Which math function to apply to the channels. All of the functions are unary functions except for the binary functions 'arctan (Input1/Input2)' and 'Input1 ^ Input2'. In the cases of power functions, a negative base is inverted first to avoid imaginary numbers, and the result is negated.

Base Value baseval - The value of the base for 'Log base N' and 'Base ^ Input1'. parameter name /baseval

Exponent Value expval - The value of the exponent for 'Input1 ^ Exponent'. channel name /expval

Angle Units angunit - ⊞ - For trigonometric functions, the angles can be measured in Degrees, Radians, or Cycles (0 to 1).

Match by match - ⊞ - How to pair channels together from the two inputs for the binary functions, by name or by channel index.



Parameters - Error Page
Error Handling error - ⊞ - How to correct samples with math errors:

+ Infinity Value pinfval - Value to use when an infinity error occurs. Caused by sinh(), cosh() and tan().

- Infinity Value ninfval - Value to use when a negative infinity error occurs. Caused by sinh() and tan().

Domain Error Value domval - Value to use when a domain error occurs. Caused by asin(), acos(), log10(), logN(), ln() and sqrt().

Divide Error Value divval - Value to use when a divide by zero error occurs. Caused by pow(x,y).



Parameters - Common Page
Time Slice timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

Scope scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

Sample Rate Match srselect - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

Export Method exportmethod - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

Export Root autoexportroot - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

Export Table exporttable - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

Rename from commonrenamefrom - The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

Rename to commonrenameto - The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement.
Example:

Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient
Rename From: c* ambient
Rename To: b[1-5] amb
This example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient.

They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.

See the Rename CHOP for a further description of rename patterns.
