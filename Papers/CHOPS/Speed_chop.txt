The Speed CHOP converts speed (units per second) to distance (units) over a time range. More generally, you give it a rate (the CHOP input) and it outputs a cumulative value. For example, the Speed CHOP converts rotation rate (rotations per second) into the number of rotation turns. ( Math-heads recognize this as an 'integral', which calculates the area under a curve. The curve is the incoming channel values over a time range, the output is the area.)

If you send a Constant CHOP channel that has value 1 into the Speed CHOP, then the Speed CHOP output will increase by 1 every second. If you feed it -2, it will decrease by 2 every second, and if you feed it 0, the output will not change. Use a Trail CHOP to see its results. You can reset the Speed CHOP to 0 by pressing the Reset parameter, or by sending in a channel (whose value is greater than 0) into the second input.

The first input contains the channels to be 'integrated'. By default, the Speed CHOP is time-sliced, so it keeps adding/subtracting to the output each frame it cooks. If you turn off its Time Slice parameter and send it a CHOP with a fixed frame range (like a default Noise CHOP), you can see the cumulative value starting from 0.

The output is calculated by adding the input's channel values for every sample, divided by the samples per second of the Speed CHOP (typically 60), starting with the sample at the Start index. Negative input values reduce the output, positive values increase it. The cumulative values are put in the output channels.

When the CHOP is reset, its output can be set to any value via the Reset Value parameter.

When the second input is used to reset the output, where the second input is greater than 0, the area is reset and held to the reset value. For example, a Wave CHOP (which is negative half the time) when passed into the second input causes the output to be reset for half a cycle.


arameters - Speed Page
Order order - ⊞ - Determines the order of the integral to use. If the input is a velocity, a First Order integral will return the position. If the input is an acceleration, a Second Order integral will return the position, and a First Order integral will return the velocity.

Speed speed - Allows generating values when no inputs are connected. This parameter is disabled as soon as an input is connected to the Speed CHOP.

First Constant constant1 - Constant to add to the entire result after integrating once.

Second Constant constant2 - Constant to add to the entire result after integrating twice.

Third Constant constant3 - Constant to add to the entire result after integrating three times.

Limit Type limittype - ⊞ - Select limit options such as loop, clamp, or zigzag from the menu. The value will remain in the range from Min to less than Max.

Minimum min - The minimum value the output channel can have.

Maximum max - The maximum value the output channel can have.

Speed per Sample speedsamples - Applies the speed to each sample of the channel instead of across the whole channel. Useful for working with multi-sample channels.

Reset Condition resetcondition - ⊞ - This menu determines how the Reset input triggers a reset of the channel(s).

Reset Value resetvalue - The channel(s) is set to this value when reset.

Reset reset - ⊞ - While On, this toggle resets the channel(s) to the Reset Value.

Reset on Start resetonstart - While On, the Speed CHOP will reset each time the .toe file is restarted. If the Speed CHOP's value gets too large it can start stepping as when it reaches the limit of CHOP's number resolution. This is useful for projects that run for a long time, restarting the file will reset this value.

Reset Pulse resetpulse - Click to instantly resets the channel(s) to the Reset Value.

Reset On Start resetonstart - While On, the Speed CHOP will reset each time the .toe file is restarted. If the Speed CHOP's value gets too large it can start stepping as when it reaches the limit of CHOP's number resolution. This is useful for projects that run for a long time, restarting the file will reset this value.



Parameters - Common Page
Time Slice timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

Scope scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

Sample Rate Match srselect - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

Export Method exportmethod - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

Export Root autoexportroot - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

Export Table exporttable - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

Rename from commonrenamefrom - The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

Rename to commonrenameto - The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement.
Example:

Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient
Rename From: c* ambient
Rename To: b[1-5] amb
This example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient.

They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.

See the Rename CHOP for a further description of rename patterns.
