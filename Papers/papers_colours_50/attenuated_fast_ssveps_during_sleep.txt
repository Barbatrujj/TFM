attenuated fast ssveps during sleep

this study investigates how steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssveps) are affected during sleep. using eeg, the authors show that rapid responses to periodic visual stimuli are significantly attenuated compared to wakefulness, indicating a decrease in neural synchronization and cortical sensitivity during different sleep stages. these results help to understand how visual processing and cortical attention change in altered states of consciousness
