the architecture of the colour centre in the human visual cortex

this study analyzes the functional organization of area v4, considered the color center in the human visual cortex. using fmri, the authors show that v4 is not a single region, but a distributed set of subregions that respond selectively to different aspects of color, such as saturation, contrast, and color constancy. the results support the idea of a distributed cortical network dedicated to color processing, rather than a single module.
