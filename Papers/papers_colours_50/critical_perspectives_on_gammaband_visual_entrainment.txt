critical perspectives on gamma-band visual entrainment

this article critically reviews studies on visual entrainment in the gamma band (~30100 hz). the authors discuss methodologies, inconsistencies, and limitations in the interpretation of results, highlighting how factors such as frequency, stimulus intensity, and individual characteristics affect neural synchronization. a more rigorous approach is proposed for future research, considering both cortical dynamics and visual perception and applicability in neurotechnology
