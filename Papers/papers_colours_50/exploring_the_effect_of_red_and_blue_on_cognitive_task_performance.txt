exploring the effect of red and blue on cognitive task performance

this study analyzes how the colors red and blue influence cognitive performance. the results show that the color red tends to improve attention to detail and performance in precision tasks, while blue promotes creativity and abstract thinking. at the neurophysiological level, differences in cortical activation related to emotional modulation and cognitive load are observed. these findings support the idea that colors can systematically modulate mental states and executive functions
