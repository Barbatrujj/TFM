  <h1>Tessellations</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>What is a Tessellation?</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>tessellation</strong> is a pattern made of one or more shapes that
      are repeated across a flat surface in such a way that they cover the
      surface completely. The shapes fit together perfectly, with no gaps and
      no overlaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      In simple terms, a tessellation works like a mosaic or tiled floor, where
      the shapes repeat over and over to fill the space.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Characteristics</h2>
    <p>For a pattern to be considered a tessellation, it must follow these rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The shapes must fit together exactly.</li>
      <li>There must be no empty spaces between the shapes.</li>
      <li>The shapes must not overlap.</li>
      <li>The pattern can continue infinitely in all directions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Types of Tessellations</h2>

    <h3>Regular Tessellations</h3>
    <p>
      Regular tessellations are made using only one type of regular polygon.
      There are only three possible regular tessellations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Equilateral triangles</li>
      <li>Squares</li>
      <li>Regular hexagons</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Semi-Regular Tessellations</h3>
    <p>
      Semi-regular tessellations use two or more different regular polygons.
      The arrangement of shapes around each corner is always the same, creating
      a repeating and balanced pattern.
    </p>

    <h3>Irregular Tessellations</h3>
    <p>
      Irregular tessellations are created using shapes that are not regular
      polygons. These shapes can be curved or free-form, as long as they repeat
      without leaving gaps or overlapping.
    </p>

    <h2>Tessellations in Art</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most famous artists associated with tessellations is
      <strong>M. C. Escher</strong>. He transformed simple geometric shapes into
      animals, people, and other figures that fit together perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tessellations are also widely used in Islamic art, where repeating
      geometric patterns are an important decorative and cultural element.

    <h2>Tessellations in Everyday Life</h2>
    <p>
      Tessellations are all around us, even if we do not always notice them.
      Common examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tiled floors and walls</li>
      <li>Brick patterns</li>
      <li>Fabrics and wallpapers</li>
      <li>Honeycombs made by bees in nature</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Tessellations Are Important</h2>
    <p>
      Tessellations help us understand important ideas in geometry, such as
      symmetry, repetition, and spatial reasoning. They also show how
      mathematics and art can work together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this, tessellations are often used in education to make
      geometry more visual, creative, and engaging for students.
