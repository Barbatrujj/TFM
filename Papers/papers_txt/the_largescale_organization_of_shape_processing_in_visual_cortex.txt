the large-scale organization of shape processing in visual cortex

this study explores the large-scale organization of shape processing in the human visual cortex. using fmri and functional connectivity analysis, the authors show that shape processing is not limited to a single region (such as the loc), but involves a distributed network that includes ventral and dorsal areas. functional gradients representing different levels of form abstraction, from local features to global representations of objects, are identified. this suggests a highly integrated and hierarchical visual architecture
