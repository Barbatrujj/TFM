color, motion, and attention in the human visual cortex

this study explores how the human brain simultaneously processes color, motion, and attention in the visual cortex. using fmri, the authors show that different visual areas (such as v1, v2, v4, and mt) respond selectively to these attributes, while attention modulates the intensity and precision of activation. the results suggest that visual perception is the product of dynamic interactions between specific attribute processing and attention mechanisms, enabling an integrated representation of stimuli
