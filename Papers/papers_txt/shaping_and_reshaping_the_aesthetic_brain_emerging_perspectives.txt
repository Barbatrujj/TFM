shaping and reshaping the aesthetic brain: emerging perspectives

this article reviews how aesthetic experience modifies brain activity and visual perception. the authors discuss how visual, musical, and artistic stimuli activate networks that include the visual cortex, reward areas, and frontal regions. in addition, they explore how repeated exposure and prior experience can reconfigure aesthetic perception and neural response, providing evidence for brain plasticity in artistic appreciation
