steady-state visually evoked potentials: paradigms and perspectives

this article provides a comprehensive review of steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssveps), a periodic neural response generated by rhythmic visual stimuli. the authors discuss the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, optimal stimulation frequencies, and applications in cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces. it is highlighted that the frequency and intensity of the visual stimulus can modulate the amplitude and phase of the cortical response, providing information on neural synchronization and visual plasticity
