CORE COLOUR PHILOSOPHY
SYMBOLIC COLOUR USAGE


Gaudi assigns symbolic meaning to colour,
particularly in religious contexts.


Examples:
- Blue: heaven, spirituality
- Green: life, renewal
- Red: sacrifice, vitality
- Gold: divinity, light


Rule:
Colour choices often reinforce narrative or symbolism,
not just aesthetics.

LIGHT-DEPENDENT COLOUR


Description:
Gaudi designs colour to interact with natural light.
Stained glass and ceramics change appearance over time.


Characteristics:
- Morning and evening colours differ
- Shadows intensify saturation
- Direct light reveals texture


Rule:
Colour should be evaluated in changing light conditions,
not fixed illumination.

COLOUR DISTRIBUTION RULES


- Colour density varies across surfaces
- No single dominant hue everywhere
- Bright colours appear in focal zones
- Neutral tones dominate structural masses


Avoid:
- Uniform colour fills
- Minimalist palettes
- High-contrast black and white schemes

SUMMARY FOR MODEL CONDITIONING


Gaudi-style colour is:
- Material-driven
- Fragmented and irregular
- Inspired by nature
- Reactive to light
- Symbolically informed


High-level instruction:
When generating Gaudi-inspired visuals,
use colour to enhance form, material, and light.
Avoid flat, digital, or synthetic colour application.
