	\section{Motivation and research problem}
		This project was motivated by a of academic interests and personal experiences. A strong curiosity for both audio and video has always been shared by us. Coming from backgrounds in audiovisual engineering and graphic design, we tend to approach creations with a critical and analytical eye. When it came time to choose a topic for our final master's project, we realized quickly that our interests were closely aligned. After engaging in numerous in-depth dialogues, we arrived at the decision to concentrate our research into two primary areas: the realm of visuals and music, along with the dynamic interplay between these two forms of expression. This intersection felt like the natural place where our skills, passions, and professional perspectives converged. Después de investigar un poco nos dimos cuenta de que en muchos shows, los visuales no tenían relación con la música. Aunque muchos visuales realmente son increíbles, como por ejemplo los hehcos por Anyma, estos tienen simplemente un propósito estético.
